## 🤖 GEMINI CLI INTEGRATION (Token Budget — READ FIRST)

> **Core rule: Gemini reads, scans, and generates. Claude decides, verifies, and writes.**
> Gemini CLI is free (Google One AI Pro, 1M context), authenticated as davchen1117@gmail.com.
> Offload all large-text reads and prose generation to Gemini to conserve Claude tokens.

### Division of labor

| Task | Who does it | Command pattern |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| Read & parse `ats_jobs.json` / `jobspy_results.json` | **Gemini Pro** | `cat file.json \| gemini -m gemini-2.5-pro -p "..."` |
| Filter/score discovery candidates against hard constraints | **Gemini Pro** | `cat listings.txt \| gemini -m gemini-2.5-pro -p "..."` |
| Read full JD text after WebFetch | **Gemini Pro** | `echo "$JD_TEXT" \| gemini -m gemini-2.5-pro -p "..."` |
| Draft Notion page content (why fit, gaps, tailoring, outreach) | **Gemini Pro** | `cat profile_compact.md jd.txt \| gemini -m gemini-2.5-pro -p "..."` |
| Draft email_body.txt | **Gemini Pro** | `cat profile_compact.md picks.txt \| gemini -m gemini-2.5-pro -p "..."` |
| Draft telegram_msg.txt | **Gemini Pro** | `echo "$PICKS_SUMMARY" \| gemini -m gemini-2.5-pro -p "..."` |
| All MCP calls (Notion, Gmail, Slack) | **Claude only** | Gemini has zero MCP support |
| Fit judgment, go/stretch/pass decisions | **Claude only** | Requires Jamie's full context + judgment |
| All file writes to disk | **Claude only** | Write tool |
| H1B verification decisions | **Claude only** | Judgment call, not pattern matching |

### Syntax quick reference

```bash
# Pipe pre-fetched job data to Gemini for filtering
cat "C:\Windows\Temp\ats_jobs.json" | gemini -m gemini-2.5-pro -p "Filter these jobs: keep only roles matching People/HR/OD/L&D scope, <5 yrs experience required, US-based or remote. Return job title, company, URL, and reason kept. Reject silently."

# Pipe pasted listings text for initial scoring
echo "$PASTED_LISTINGS" | gemini -m gemini-2.5-pro -p "Apply these hard reject rules: [paste rules]. Return: KEEP or REJECT | title | company | reason. One line per job."

# Pipe a JD + profile to draft Notion enrichment content
cat profile_compact.md jd_raw.txt | gemini -m gemini-2.5-pro -p "Draft Oracle enrichment: Why Fit (3 bullets), Gaps (2 bullets), Resume Tailoring (3 bullet swaps), H1B note. Use Jamie's experience only — no invention. Return structured sections."

# Draft full email body
cat picks_summary.txt bible_verse.txt | gemini -m gemini-2.5-pro -p "Draft the Oracle daily digest email to Jamie. Follow this structure: [paste email template]. Return plain text only, no markdown."
```

### Where each step uses Gemini (see inline 🤖 markers throughout)

- **Step 0.5** — pipe `ats_jobs.json` and `jobspy_results.json` through Gemini Flash for pre-filtering
- **Step 2** — pipe pasted listings or discovery text through Gemini Flash for hard-gate filtering
- **Step 3f** — pipe fetched JD text through Gemini Flash for structured data extraction
- **Step 6** — pipe JD + profile to Gemini Pro to draft all Notion page prose sections
- **Step 8** — pipe picks summary to Gemini Pro to draft `email_body.txt`
- **Step 9** — pipe picks summary to Gemini Flash to draft `telegram_msg.txt`

---

## 🔄 STEP 0 — Sync Latest Updates

> **ALWAYS do this first.** Jamie's feedback and preferences may have been updated from her
> Mac sessions. Pull the latest before every run.

```bash
git pull origin main
```

Then read `jamie/profile_compact.md` — it contains all hard constraints, scoring formula,
and H1B quick reference. Only read `jamie/preferences.md` if you need the full
self-assessment table or networking templates (i.e., during enrichment, not discovery).

**After the run:** If you updated any reference files (h1b_verified.md, watchlist.md, etc.),
commit and push so Jamie's next session has the latest data.

```bash
git add jamie/ && git commit -m "Update reference files from Oracle run $(date +%Y-%m-%d)" && git push
```

---

## 🔌 STEP 0.5 — Pre-Fetch via APIs & Scripts (NEW v3.3)

> **Run BEFORE the main pipeline.** These scripts pull structured job data from public APIs
> and scraper libraries — faster, more reliable, and more exhaustive than WebSearch alone.
> Their output files are read by the main pipeline as additional discovery sources.

### 0.5a. Greenhouse + Lever API Fetch

```bash
cd "C:\Users\chent\Agentic_Workflows_2026\oracle-job-search"
python pipeline/scripts/fetch_ats_jobs.py
```

- Queries **public JSON APIs** (no auth needed) for all companies in `pipeline/ats_mapping.json`
- Greenhouse: `GET https://api.greenhouse.io/v1/boards/{slug}/jobs?content=true`
- Lever: `GET https://api.lever.co/v0/postings/{slug}?mode=json`
- Filters for People/HR/OD/L&D keywords, excludes Senior/Director/VP
- **Output:** `C:\Windows\Temp\ats_jobs.json` — read this in Step 2 as a pre-verified source
- These jobs are **already live** (API returns only active postings) — skip Chrome verification for them
- **Verified ATS slugs (14 companies):** Stripe, Figma, Discord, Roblox, Airbnb, Duolingo, HubSpot, Cloudflare, Datadog, Twilio, Block, Epic Games, Riot Games, Spotify

> 🤖 **GEMINI — pipe output for pre-filtering:**
> ```bash
> cat "C:\Windows\Temp\ats_jobs.json" | gemini -m gemini-2.5-pro -p "Filter these jobs for Jamie Cheng. Keep: People/HR/OD/L&D/Consulting scope, <5 yrs experience required, H1B-eligible company. Reject: Senior/Director/VP, pure TA/recruiting, instructional design. Return one line per kept job: TITLE | COMPANY | URL | WHY KEPT"
> ```
> Claude reads Gemini's filtered output — do NOT read the raw JSON yourself.

### 0.5b. JobSpy Scraper (optional — deeper LinkedIn/Indeed coverage)

```bash
python pipeline/scripts/jobspy_search.py
```

- Scrapes LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor concurrently using `python-jobspy`
- Indeed has **zero rate limiting** (best scraping source)
- LinkedIn caps at ~page 10 per IP (~100 results) — still catches jobs WebSearch misses
- Runs 6 US search configs + 2 NL configs (with `--include-nl` flag)
- **Output:** `C:\Windows\Temp\jobspy_results.json` + `.csv`
- **Install once:** `pip install -r pipeline/scripts/requirements.txt`

> 🤖 **GEMINI — pipe JobSpy output for filtering (same pattern as ATS):**
> ```bash
> cat "C:\Windows\Temp\jobspy_results.json" | gemini -m gemini-2.5-pro -p "Filter these scraped job listings for an HR/People/OD professional with ~3 yrs experience needing H1B sponsorship. Hard reject: Senior/VP/Director titles, 5+ yrs required, pure TA/recruiting. Return: TITLE | COMPANY | URL | LOCATION | KEEP/REJECT | REASON"
> ```

### 0.5c. Email Alerts Check (Gmail MCP)

> **Set up once:** Create job alert emails on LinkedIn, Indeed, and Glassdoor for Jamie's
> top search queries. Alerts deliver new postings to `jamiecheng0103@gmail.com` daily.
> This catches jobs that Brave-backed WebSearch misses (WebSearch ≠ Google; ~13% miss rate).

At the start of each run, search Gmail for recent job alert emails:

```
gmail_search_messages(q="subject:(job alert OR new jobs OR jobs for you) newer_than:2d", maxResults=10)
```

For each alert email:
1. `gmail_read_message(messageId)` — extract job titles, companies, and URLs
2. Add any new jobs to the discovery candidate pool (Step 2)
3. These still need Chrome/WebFetch verification (alerts may contain expired listings)

### 0.5d. LinkedIn "Top Job Picks" — PRIMARY Discovery Source (NEW v3.4.2)

> **This is the single highest-signal discovery source.** LinkedIn's recommendation algorithm
> already knows Jamie's profile, skills, work history, and search behavior — it pre-filters
> all 500M+ listings down to the ~381 most relevant. Use it at the start of EVERY run.

**How to access:**

1. In Chrome, navigate to:
   ```
   https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/collections/recommended/
   ```

2. This opens the **"Top job picks for you"** page — a **two-panel interface**:
   - **Left panel**: Scrollable job list, each card shows company, title, location, and H1B/PERM/E-Verify badges
   - **Right panel**: Full job description for the currently selected job — loads instantly when you click a listing
   - **URL updates** to `?currentJobId=JOBID` when you click a listing — each job has a stable permalink

3. **Scroll through the left panel** to collect all visible listings (381 results available). You can also click into individual jobs to read the full JD on the right panel WITHOUT leaving the page.

4. **To read a full JD**: Click the job title in the left panel → right panel updates with:
   - Full description (responsibilities, qualifications, company overview)
   - Hiring manager / job poster with LinkedIn profile (useful for outreach in Step 5)
   - Salary range, work type (on-site/hybrid/remote), applicant count, posting date

5. **Key filter signals visible per listing (no clicking needed):**
   - 🟢 **H1B badge** = employer confirmed H1B in LinkedIn's database — high priority for Jamie
   - **PERM badge** = employer has PERM history (likely willing to sponsor long-term)
   - **E-Verify badge** = on the federal E-Verify system (baseline for sponsorship likelihood)
   - **"X school alumni work here"** = alumni connection (USC or Wesleyan → mention in outreach)
   - **"Be an early applicant"** = posted recently, low competition — prioritize these
   - **"You'd be a top applicant"** = strong profile match — always evaluate these

**Recommended workflow per run:**
```
1. Navigate to https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/collections/recommended/
2. Scroll through left panel, noting all visible listings (title, company, location, badges)
3. Click each promising listing → read full JD in right panel
4. Copy job title, company, URL (from ?currentJobId= param or "share" button), and key JD details
5. Add all candidates to the discovery pool — treat as pre-vetted by LinkedIn's algorithm
6. These jobs still need H1B verification (check jamie/h1b_verified.md + WebSearch if unknown)
7. Proceed to Step 3 scoring as normal
```

> ⚠️ **Do NOT only screenshot the left panel.** Reading the full JD in the right panel is
> essential — the title alone won't tell you if the role requires 5+ years or if it's a fit.
> Click through each promising listing before scoring.

> ⚠️ **LinkedIn "Jobs for You" ≠ LinkedIn search results.** Do NOT use the LinkedIn search bar.
> The `/jobs/collections/recommended/` URL is the algorithm-curated feed — it surfaces roles
> specifically matched to Jamie's profile. The search bar returns generic keyword results.

### 🚀 MANUAL PASTE MODE (Token-Efficient — Preferred)

> **Use this when David has Chrome open himself.** Instead of Claude navigating LinkedIn
> (expensive: ~5K tokens per page load), David scrolls LinkedIn "Top Job Picks" himself
> and pastes the visible listing text directly into the chat.

**How to use:**
1. Open https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/collections/recommended/ in your browser
2. Scroll through the left panel — copy-paste ALL visible listing text into the chat
   (title, company, location, badges — just select-all and paste, raw text is fine)
3. Say: "Here are today's listings — run the pipeline"

**What Claude does in manual paste mode:**
- Skips ALL Chrome navigation (Steps 0.5d, Chrome verification for pasted jobs)
- Reads the pasted text as the discovery pool
- Still uses WebFetch for individual job URL verification (much cheaper than Chrome)
- Proceeds directly to scoring (Step 3)

> ⚡ **Token savings:** ~15-25K tokens per run. Recommended as default when David is at his desk.

### How Pre-Fetch & LinkedIn integrate with Step 2

> **LinkedIn "Top Job Picks" is now the PRIMARY discovery source (v3.5).**
> LinkedIn's algorithm already filters 500M+ listings to ~381 tailored recommendations.
> These are high-signal, pre-vetted candidates that cost zero WebSearch tokens.
>
> **Early-exit rule (v3.5 — Token Budget Optimization):**
> If LinkedIn Top Job Picks yields **5+ viable candidates** (pass hard constraints,
> worth evaluating), **skip Agents A-F WebSearch entirely.** LinkedIn already did
> the discovery work — running 6 parallel WebSearch agents on top is redundant
> and burns ~10K+ tokens for marginal yield.
>
> **When to run full discovery (Agents A-F):**
> - LinkedIn yields < 5 viable candidates
> - David explicitly says "run full discovery" or "deep search"
> - It's been 3+ days since the last full discovery run
> - Looking for cap-exempt roles specifically (LinkedIn doesn't filter for this well)
>
> **ATS pre-fetch** is still a supplement — run it if the Python scripts are available,
> but it's lower priority than LinkedIn.

In Step 2 discovery, BEFORE launching WebSearch agents:
1. Read `C:\Windows\Temp\ats_jobs.json` (if exists, < 24 hours old)
2. Read `C:\Windows\Temp\jobspy_results.json` (if exists, < 24 hours old)
3. Add all jobs from these files to the candidate pool
4. **ATS API jobs skip Chrome verification** (they are confirmed live by the API)
5. **JobSpy + email alert jobs still need Chrome verification** (scraped data may be stale)
6. Deduplicate by URL across all sources before proceeding to Step 3
7. **DO NOT score or pick from ATS results alone** — wait for ALL discovery agents to complete

## 🖥️ PREREQUISITES — Read Before Running

### Chrome Browser (REQUIRED)

> ⚠️ **CRITICAL: Claude in Chrome MUST be connected before running this pipeline.**
> Without Chrome, Claude cannot read full job descriptions or verify postings are live.
> **Proven failure mode:** In one session without Chrome, ALL 5 picks were dead jobs (0/5 success rate).
> Google search results and secondary aggregators (ZipRecruiter, WORK180, LinkedIn cached) do NOT
> update when a job closes. Only the actual job posting URL reflects true status.

**Before starting, check Chrome connection:**
```
Call: mcp__Claude_in_Chrome__tabs_context_mcp(createIfEmpty: true)
```

**If Chrome is NOT connected:**
1. STOP the pipeline immediately
2. Tell the user: "⚠️ I need your Chrome browser open with the Claude in Chrome extension connected before I can run the job search. Without it, I have no way to verify job postings are actually live — the last time I ran without Chrome, all 5 picks were dead. Please open Chrome and confirm the extension is connected, then I'll proceed."
3. Wait for user to confirm Chrome is open and extension is active
4. Re-check connection before proceeding

**Why Chrome matters — the "stale listing" problem:**
- Google search results show job postings from ZipRecruiter, WORK180, LinkedIn, and other aggregators
- These secondary sites do NOT update when the original job closes — they can show a listing as "active" for months after it's filled
- The ONLY reliable source of truth is the actual job posting URL (Greenhouse, Lever, Workday, company careers page)
- Without Chrome, I am essentially flying blind and picking from cached, potentially months-old data

**If Chrome IS connected:** Proceed with pipeline.

### User Action Required

The user (David) must have:
- Chrome browser open with Claude in Chrome extension connected
- LinkedIn logged in (for reading job postings and finding networking contacts)
- Chrome should remain open throughout the pipeline run (~15-30 minutes)

## 🔁 Pipeline Philosophy — Quality Over Quantity

> **Core principle: Surface ALL genuinely viable jobs each run. Let Jamie choose.**
>
> Jamie can carefully apply to 1-2 jobs per day. Each application takes 30-60 min of her real time.
> Every job surfaced must be genuinely worth that investment based on her ACTUAL experience.
>
> **Show all ⭐+ candidates. Enrich the top 3. No artificial cap.**
> It's better to send Jamie 0 jobs than to send 1 bad one. But if there are 5 good ones,
> show all 5 — she'll prioritize. The email digest ranks them; enrichment (cover letter,
> networking) only runs for the top 3 by score.
>
> **The resume exaggeration trap:**
> Jamie's resume (like most resumes) uses strong framing. When writing tailoring suggestions,
> do NOT further boost or invent on top of that framing. Look at what she literally did —
> managed 3 programs, 600+ trained, 20+ vendors, onboarding redesign — and only reword within
> that scope. If the JD requires something she hasn't done, that's a GAP, not a reframe.
>
> **Location strategy (updated v2.7) — in-person/hybrid first:**
> Remote roles attract national competition. Everyone applies remotely. Jamie's H1B status + ~3 years
> = tougher to stand out vs. a local US citizen with 5 years who applies nationally.
>
> In-person and hybrid roles have far less competition. Jamie should lean into the local advantage.
> West Coast (Portland, Seattle, Bay Area, San Diego, LA) is ideal, but any US in-person/hybrid role
> is acceptable if it's a good P1–P2 fit. Even non-West-Coast cities (Austin, Chicago, NYC, Denver)
> are on the table if the role is excellent.
>
> **Only surface remote roles if they are near-perfect P1 program management or consulting fits
> with confirmed H1B sponsorship and Oregon listed as eligible state. A decent in-person role
> anywhere in the US beats a mediocre remote role every time.**

---

## 🤖 Multi-Agent Architecture (v3.1 — VERIFY ALL)

> **The pipeline can be parallelized using Claude's Agent tool.** This dramatically
> speeds up the search by running independent workstreams simultaneously.

> ⚠️ **CRITICAL RULE (v3.1): Every candidate found by ANY agent MUST be Chrome-verified**
> **before it goes anywhere — into today's picks OR into the next_run_priority_queue.**
> **Never carry forward an unverified URL. Never defer verification to "next run".**
> A URL that hasn't been Chrome-verified (or WebFetch-verified when Chrome is blocked)
> is unknown status — it could be expired, could be Canada-only, could be 5+ yrs.
> **The priority queue must only contain verified-live candidates.**

### Ashby Board Verification — CRITICAL (learned Mar 25, updated Mar 25)
> ✅ **UPDATE (Mar 25 Run 2):** WebFetch DOES work for Ashby — Ashby uses SSR (server-side rendering) and returns
> real HTML containing `window.__appData` with `"posting":null` or `"posting":{...}`. WebFetch is now the
> preferred fast-path for Ashby verification (same signal as Chrome, no browser overhead).
>
> WebSearch and LinkedIn indexing are still STALE — they show postings as "live" weeks/months after expiration.
> Do NOT trust WebSearch/LinkedIn as final answer for Ashby.
>
> **Definitive Ashby expired signal (WebFetch or Chrome):** Response body contains `"posting":null`
> **Definitive Ashby live signal (WebFetch or Chrome):** Response body contains `"posting":{...}` with actual job data
> If `"posting":null` → job is gone. Period. Do not second-guess LinkedIn or search results.
>
> **Ashby verification checklist (use WebFetch first; fall back to Chrome if WebFetch fails/blocked):**
> 1. `WebFetch(ashby_url)` → search response for `"posting":null` or `"posting":{`
> 2. If `posting:null` → EXPIRED. If posting has content → LIVE (read YOE, location, etc. from the JSON)
> 3. If WebFetch is blocked or returns empty HTML → fall back to Chrome `get_page_text`
> 4. WebSearch results showing "LIVE" for Ashby jobs = UNRELIABLE. Always direct-verify.

### Verification Fallback (when Chrome is blocked)
Some job boards block Chrome navigation (Greenhouse, LinkedIn, Stripe). For these:
1. Try `WebFetch(url)` first — if it returns a real JD, the posting is live
2. If WebFetch also fails, use `WebSearch("site:domain.com company role name 2026")` to confirm status
3. **For Ashby specifically:** WebFetch now confirmed reliable (SSR HTML contains `posting:null` signal).
   Use WebFetch as primary; fall back to Chrome `get_page_text` only if WebFetch fails/blocked.
   Do NOT rely on WebSearch/LinkedIn indexing as final answer — they are stale by weeks/months.
4. If neither works and status is unknown → mark as "⚠️ unverified" in the queue, do NOT include in today's picks
5. Always log the verification method used (Chrome / WebFetch / WebSearch)

### Parallelization Rules (v3.2 — exhaustive, auto-compact safe)

**Context auto-compact:** Claude Code automatically compacts conversation history when approaching the context limit. This applies to ALL sessions including sub-agents. The pipeline is designed to be resilient to compaction: every agent writes results to a temp file progressively (every 5 URLs), so compaction never loses work. If the main thread compacts mid-pipeline, it resumes from the last written file.

- **Step 1 (DB Audit)** can run simultaneously with **Step 2 (Discovery)** — they're independent
- **Step 0.5 (Pre-Fetch)** — run Python scripts BEFORE agents: `fetch_ats_jobs.py` (Greenhouse/Lever APIs) + `jobspy_search.py` (Indeed/LinkedIn scraper) + Gmail alerts check. Read their output JSONs into the candidate pool.
- **Step 2 Discovery** — launch ALL of the following as background agents simultaneously:
  - Agent A: LinkedIn Greenhouse/Lever site: searches (P1 batches A–H10)
  - Agent B: LinkedIn P2 batches (J–R15) + P3 consulting batches (S–X)
  - Agent C: Direct company career sites from watchlist.md Tier 1-2 (tech + gaming)
  - Agent D: Cap-exempt employers (nonprofits, hospitals, universities — Tier 3) + HigherEdJobs
  - Agent E: Alt boards (Handshake, Built In, SHRM, Idealist, Wellfound) + Remote boards (FlexJobs, WWR, Remote.co)
  - Agent F: PNW local searches (Portland/Seattle Batches Y–AF) + Greenhouse/Lever bulk WebSearch
  - Each agent returns a raw URL list + title + company. No verification — just discovery.
  - **⚠️ AGENT OUTPUT QUALITY RULES (v3.4.1):**
    - Return ONLY direct job posting URLs (containing a specific job ID or posting slug)
    - Do NOT return search result pages, category pages, or aggregator landing pages
    - Do NOT return LinkedIn hub pages (e.g., linkedin.com/jobs/hr-coordinator-jobs)
    - Do NOT return Glassdoor search URLs (e.g., glassdoor.com/Job/remote-...-jobs-SRCH_...)
    - Each result MUST have: exact job title, company name, direct apply URL
    - If a WebSearch only returns aggregator pages, note "no direct URLs found" and move on
    - Dedup within each agent: same company+title = one entry only
  - **⚠️ SKIP LIST IS COMPANY+TITLE PAIRS (v3.4.1):**
    - Do NOT skip an entire company. Only skip the exact (company, role title) pair.
    - Example: skip "Early Career PM @ Roblox" but keep "People Ops Coordinator @ Roblox"
- **⚠️ WAIT GATE: ALL discovery agents (A–F) MUST complete before Step 3 begins.**
  Do NOT start verification or scoring based on ATS pre-fetch alone. The cap-exempt
  and Portland-local roles from Agents D and F are often the best picks — they take
  longer to discover but are higher value for Jamie's specific situation.
- **Step 3 (Verification — ALL candidates, exhaustive):**
  - **Route by ATS type** (see Step 3a URL routing table)
  - **Main thread:** Ashby URLs (Chrome `get_page_text`) + LinkedIn URLs (Chrome)
  - **Parallel background agents:** all other ATSes (Greenhouse, Lever, Workday, direct sites via WebFetch)
  - Launch ceil(non-Ashby count / 15) agents in parallel — max 6 simultaneous
  - Each agent writes `verify_batch_{id}.json` progressively (every 5 URLs verified)
  - Main thread collects all batch files → merges into `verified_candidates.json`
  - **ALL candidates verified before Step 4.** No carryforward of unverified URLs.
- **Step 6 (Enrichment)** — launch 3 parallel background agents (one per pick). Each writes a complete Notion page draft, cover letter, networking contacts, outreach messages.
- **Delivery** — serial (depends on enrichment completing). Main thread only.

### Priority Queue Rules (next_run_priority_queue.md)
- **Only verified-live candidates enter the queue.** No unverified URLs.
- Every queue entry must record: `verified_date`, `verified_method` (Chrome/WebFetch/WebSearch), `live_status`, `yoe_req`, `location`.
- At the START of the next run, re-verify Tier 1 queue entries (they may expire overnight).
- Expired entries → mark as "Pass 👋" in Notion, remove from queue immediately.
- `verified_candidates.json` persists across sessions — if interrupted, resume from this file.

### When to Use Agents vs. Main Thread
- **Use Agent tool** for: discovery WebSearch batches, WebFetch verification batches, cover letter writing, networking research
- **Use main thread** for: Chrome verification (Ashby + LinkedIn), Notion MCP calls, Gmail draft, file writes, collecting agent outputs
- **Use `run_in_background: true`** for ALL discovery agents AND all WebFetch verification agents
- **Progressive writes mandatory** for any agent doing >5 sequential verifications — write partial results to file, do not hold in memory

### Model Selection — Use the Cheapest Model That Can Do the Job (v3.4.2)

> Token spend compounds fast across parallel agents. Defaulting everything to Sonnet wastes
> budget on mechanical tasks that Haiku handles perfectly. Always specify `model:` explicitly.

| Agent task | Model | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Discovery WebSearch batches (A–F) | `haiku` | Keyword search + URL extraction — no judgment needed |
| WebFetch verification batches | `haiku` | Read page → check live/expired — mechanical |
| Notion DB audit / scoring patch | `haiku` | Formula application — pure computation |
| Notion CRUD (add/update pages) | `haiku` | Property writes — no judgment |
| Watchlist / ATS API fetch | `haiku` | Structured data pull — no judgment |
| Step 1 DB audit agent | `haiku` | Read Notion → check missing fields → update |
| Step 3 verification agents (non-Ashby) | `haiku` | WebFetch + live/expired decision |
| Step 6 enrichment agents (cover letter, outreach) | `sonnet` | Drafting requires voice + judgment |
| Fit evaluation / scoring for new roles | `sonnet` | Requires understanding of Jamie's situation |
| LinkedIn "Jobs for You" browsing + JD reading | `sonnet` | Judgment-heavy triage |
| Orchestrator / main thread | `sonnet` | Coordinates everything — needs full capability |

**Rule:** In every `Agent` tool call, set `model: "haiku"` unless the task is in the Sonnet row above.
**Never** leave model unspecified for background agents — it defaults to Sonnet and burns budget.

## ⚡ Urgency Scoring (v3.0)

> Jobs posted < 3 days ago at companies with fast hiring cycles get an urgency flag.

### Urgency Levels
- **⚡ URGENT — apply within 24-48 hrs**: Posted today or yesterday. Fresh listing.
- **🔶 FRESH — apply this week**: Posted 2-7 days ago. Still early in the applicant pool.
- **⏳ AGING — apply soon or skip**: Posted 8-14 days ago. Likely many applicants already.
- **💤 STALE — skip unless perfect fit**: Posted 15-30 days ago. High competition.

### In the Email Digest
Prepend urgency tag to each pick:
```
⚡ URGENT #1  Early Career PM @ Roblox  (posted yesterday!)
🔶 FRESH #2  Talent Engagement @ Flatiron  (posted 5 days ago)
```

### In Notion Page
Add urgency level to the Notes property:
```
⚡ URGENT — posted Mar 23, apply by Mar 25
```

---

## 📋 Pipeline Steps

### Step 1 — Audit Existing Notion DB

> **⚠️ CRITICAL: `notion-search` returns max 10 results per query. The DB may have 20–40+ entries.**
> You MUST run MULTIPLE search queries with varied keywords to find ALL entries before auditing.
> Never assume you've seen everything after a single search.

**1a-pre. Check Google Sheets for already-applied roles (NEW v3.4):**

> ⚠️ **CRITICAL: The Notion DB does NOT contain all roles Jamie has applied to.**
> The ground truth for applications + rejections is the Google Sheet.
> Flatiron Health was resurfaced in Run 6 despite Jamie already being rejected —
> because the pipeline only checked Notion (which didn't have it from a prior manual app).

Before auditing Notion, fetch the Google Sheet to build a dedup list:

```
WebFetch(url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tRN3KMGHOSyRMf14TRUj3wPldbM9fwDxVu9XsEH6s2E/export?format=csv&gid=1018026840", prompt="Extract all rows as {company, title, status} objects from the 2026 tab.")
```

> ⚠️ **DEDUP BY COMPANY+TITLE PAIR, NOT BY COMPANY ALONE (v3.4.1):**
> The skip list should contain **specific (company, role title) pairs**, not entire companies.
> Jamie may have applied to "Early Career PM" at Roblox — but Roblox could post a
> "People Operations Coordinator" next week. That's a DIFFERENT role and should NOT be skipped.
>
> **Skip rule:** Only skip a discovered role if there is an EXACT or near-exact title match
> at the same company in the Google Sheet or Notion DB. "Near-exact" means the core role
> is the same (e.g., "People Ops Associate" ≈ "People Operations Associate").
> A different role at the same company is NOT skipped.
>
> **Example:**
> - Google Sheet has: Roblox — "Early Career Program Manager" → skip "Early Career PM @ Roblox"
> - Google Sheet has: Roblox — "Early Career Program Manager" → DO NOT skip "People Ops Coordinator @ Roblox"
> - Notion has: Flatiron — "TEE Associate" (Pass) → skip "TEE Associate @ Flatiron"
> - Notion has: Flatiron — "TEE Associate" (Pass) → DO NOT skip "L&D Coordinator @ Flatiron" (if it existed)

**1a. Exhaust the full DB with multi-batch searches** — Run ALL of the following queries in sequence, collecting unique page IDs across all batches:

```
Batch 1: query="coordinator analyst"              → OD/PM/L&D coordinator and analyst roles
Batch 2: query="HR people operations"             → HR, People Ops, HRBP entries
Batch 3: query="consulting talent"                → consulting, talent management, T&O roles
Batch 4: query="program manager"                  → all program manager variants
Batch 5: query="specialist partner generalist"    → specialists, partners, generalists
Batch 6: query="Mercer Disney Ampere Instacart"   → known active companies (update each run!)
Batch 7: query="Redox Newsela Clarios"            → more active companies
Batch 8: query="pass rejected applied"            → catch Pass 👋 and other status entries
Batch 9: query="change management OCM learning"   → OCM, L&D, OD variants
Batch 10: query="experience business partner"     → HRBP and EX variants
```

⚠️ **Update Batch 6 & 7 company names each run** — replace with the actual companies currently in the DB. After each run, the companies will change. Run extra batches if DB is known to be large (30+ entries).

Deduplicate by page ID across all batches. This should surface all entries.
If a batch returns 10 results, run additional keyword-varied queries until batches return <5 new unique IDs.

**1b. Build skip list** — Extract every **(company, role title) pair** (any status) to avoid exact duplicates. Do NOT skip entire companies — only skip the specific role that was already tracked.

**1c. Verify EVERY "New 🆕" entry via Chrome — METICULOUS** — For EACH entry:

**DO NOT rely on tab title alone.** Always read the actual page content.

```
Step 1: navigate to the job URL
Step 2: get_page_text(tabId) — read actual text, not just screenshot
Step 3: Check content for status signals
```

**Status signals to look for in page TEXT:**
- ✅ Live: "Apply now", "Submit application", active application form visible
- ❌ Dead (Greenhouse): page text contains "error" or "An error occurred" or URL has `?error=true`
- ❌ Dead (Lever): page returns HTTP 404 or "Job not found"
- ❌ Dead (Workday): page text contains "The page you are looking for doesn't exist." with a "Search for Jobs" button — this is Workday's 404 for expired postings
- ❌ Dead (LinkedIn): text contains "No longer accepting applications"
- ❌ Dead (LinkedIn): text contains "This job is no longer available"
- ❌ Dead (LinkedIn — ghost listing): text shows "Reposted X months/years ago" AND applicant count is 0 or near-zero — these are zombie listings never removed from the platform; DELETE
- ❌ Dead (General): text contains "This position has been filled" or "job has been removed"
- ❌ Dead (General): company career page shows only generic jobs/search page — no specific JD found — DELETE (no specific URL = unverifiable)
- ❌ Dead (Redirect): URL redirected to generic `/jobs` or search results page (not a specific JD)
- ❌ Closed (ZipRecruiter/Indeed): "This job listing is no longer active"
- ❌ Visa fail: text contains "US citizens only", "no visa sponsorship", "must be authorized"
- ❌ No URL: Notion entry has only a company homepage (e.g., `company.com/careers`) with no specific job ID in the URL — treat as unverifiable, DELETE unless a direct posting URL can be found

**For entries where job URL leads to LinkedIn or similar:**
- Read full page text — look explicitly for "No longer accepting applications"
- LinkedIn posts > 30 days with "No longer accepting" = archived entry
- LinkedIn "Reposted X years ago" with 0 applicants = zombie ghost listing = archived entry

**For entries on company career sites (Greenhouse/Lever/Workday):**
- Greenhouse error page = expired (add to cleanup list)
- Lever 404 = expired (add to cleanup list)
- Workday "page doesn't exist" = expired (add to cleanup list)
- Page loads with full JD and Apply button = live (verify freshness)

**If live → extract posted date (REQUIRED v3.4.1):**
- Look for "Posted X days ago", "Published date", or date in the page metadata
- Record the exact or approximate posted date for EVERY verified-live role
- This date goes into the Notion "Posted Date" property and the email digest
- Posted > 30 days ago → still include but mark as 💤 STALE in email
- Do NOT auto-reject based on age alone — let Jamie decide
- If posted date cannot be determined, note "posted date unknown" rather than guessing

**1d. Mark-as-Deactivated Protocol** ← UPDATED v2.7
> ⚠️ Do NOT delete or archive entries from Notion. Keep all entries as historical records.
> When a role is expired, dead, wrong fit, or fails quality bar:
> 1. Change its **Status** to "Pass 👋"
> 2. Add a **Notes** explaining why (e.g., "Expired — job posting removed Mar 9", "Wrong location — Santa Clara not Portland")
> This preserves a complete record of all jobs reviewed, which is valuable for tracking search patterns and avoiding re-surfacing dead leads.
> The `cleanup_pages.json` file is NO LONGER used for archiving. Skip writing it.

**1e. Summary of deactivated entries** — At the end of the audit, note how many entries were marked as "Pass 👋" and the reasons, so Jamie knows what changed. Include this count in the email digest.

### Step 2 — Discovery (cast wide, filter strict)

> 🤖 **GEMINI — use for initial hard-gate filtering of all pasted/collected listings:**
> When David pastes raw job listings text (Manual Paste Mode) or after any discovery batch,
> pipe to Gemini Flash BEFORE reading them yourself:
> ```bash
> echo "PASTE_RAW_LISTINGS_HERE" | gemini -m gemini-2.5-pro -p "Apply these hard reject rules to each listing: (1) title contains Senior/VP/Director/Lead/Manager with 5+ yrs → REJECT, (2) pure recruiting/TA coordinator → REJECT, (3) instructional design → REJECT, (4) no remote + not Portland/Seattle → REJECT. For each job: KEEP or REJECT | TITLE | COMPANY | LOCATION | REASON. Be terse."
> ```
> Claude then reads only the KEEP list — skip REJECT entries entirely.

> **Search philosophy: scan up to ~1000 listings across all sources, surface ~20–40 candidates for closer review, pick at most 3.**
> The search effort is deliberately large. The filter is deliberately strict.
> More searching = more surface area to find the 1–3 genuinely excellent fits.
> Do not stop after the first few pages or first keyword batch.

> 🚫 **NO PARTIAL RUNS — ALL BATCHES MANDATORY (v3.1 mandate):**
> Multi-agent parallelization is for SPEED only — it must NOT reduce coverage.
> Every batch in sections 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d MUST run in every pipeline execution.
> Do NOT skip batches due to "enough candidates found" or "time constraints."
> The pipeline must complete all batches before moving to Step 3 verification.
> If token/time limits are a concern: launch more background agents, not fewer batches.
> **Minimum required: all P1 LinkedIn batches (A–H10) + all direct career sites (2b) + all watchlist checks (2c) + at least one alternative board (2d).**

#### 2a. LinkedIn (Chrome — primary platform)

Run ALL of the following search batches in LinkedIn. Use Chrome tabs in parallel where possible.
For each batch: scroll through ALL results (not just first 5), click into any JD that looks plausible.

**Base LinkedIn URL template:**
```
https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?keywords={KEYWORD}&f_WT=2&f_TPR=r604800&location=United%20States&sortBy=DD
```
(Remote, past 2 weeks, sorted by date)

**LinkedIn search batches — run ALL of these:**

> **P1 PRIORITY BATCHES — run these first, always:**
```
Batch A:  "people programs manager" OR "people program manager"
Batch B:  "talent development program manager"
Batch C:  "early talent program manager" OR "early talent programs"
Batch D:  "employee experience program manager"
Batch E:  "people operations program manager" OR "HR program manager"
Batch F:  "process improvement" OR "workflow optimization" "people" OR "HR"
Batch G:  "program manager" "talent" OR "people" OR "employee experience"
Batch H:  "employee engagement" program manager OR coordinator
Batch I:  "people programs" coordinator OR specialist OR lead
Batch H2: "early career program manager" OR "university programs manager" OR "campus programs coordinator"
Batch H3: "talent and engagement" associate OR coordinator

Batch H8: "talent operations" coordinator OR manager OR specialist
Batch H9: "talent strategy" analyst OR associate OR coordinator
Batch H10: "workforce planning" coordinator OR analyst (people programs scope)
```

> **P2 BATCHES — engagement, OD, OCM:**
```
Batch J:  "employee engagement manager" OR "employee experience manager"
Batch K:  "organizational change management" OR "OCM analyst" OR "OCM specialist"
Batch L:  "change enablement" analyst OR specialist
Batch M:  "organizational development specialist" OR "OD analyst" OR "OD coordinator"

Batch R2: "employee insights" OR "people insights" analyst OR coordinator (program improvement focus)
Batch R3: "voice of employee" OR "feedback programs" analyst OR coordinator
Batch R4: "HR specialist" associate OR coordinator (NOT HR Manager / HRBP — Disney/entertainment type scope)
Batch R5: "service insights" OR "experience insights" analyst OR coordinator (people/program scope ONLY — not call center)
Batch R6: "workforce insights" OR "talent insights" analyst OR coordinator
Batch R7: "continuous improvement" specialist OR coordinator — people OR HR OR talent context
Batch R8: "program excellence" OR "process excellence" coordinator — people OR employee experience context
Batch R9: "CX" OR "customer experience" program coordinator — program improvement scope (verify: NOT call center ops)
Batch R10: "stakeholder feedback" OR "feedback loop" specialist — people OR talent context
Batch R11: "talent management" specialist OR coordinator (programs focus, NOT recruiting/TA)
Batch R12: "talent program" specialist OR coordinator OR analyst (program development scope)
Batch R13: "succession planning" OR "talent review" coordinator OR analyst (talent mgmt programs)
Batch R14: "talent initiatives" OR "people initiatives" coordinator OR specialist

```

> **P3 BATCHES — consulting (entry/analyst level only):**
```
Batch S:  "people advisory" analyst OR associate
Batch T:  "human capital" analyst OR consultant (entry level)
Batch U:  "talent consulting" analyst OR associate
Batch V:  "organizational development" consultant analyst
Batch W:  "HR consulting" analyst OR associate
Batch X:  "workforce transformation" analyst
```

**Also run local Portland/Seattle batches (remove `f_WT=2` remote filter, add `f_WT=1%2C3` for on-site/hybrid, use `f_TPR=r2592000` for 30-day window):**

> **⚠️ EXPANDED LOCAL SEARCH MANDATE (updated Mar 2026):** Local Portland/Seattle in-person/hybrid roles must be searched thoroughly every run. On-site presence is a real competitive advantage for Jamie vs. remote applicants. Use the 30-day window (r2592000) for local searches. Broader job titles are valid locally — but still apply the 4-year max experience rule.

```
Batch Y:  "program manager" people OR HR OR talent — Portland, OR (on-site/hybrid)
Batch Z:  "employee engagement" OR "employee experience" specialist OR coordinator — Portland, OR + Seattle, WA
Batch AA: "people operations" associate OR coordinator OR specialist — Portland, OR (on-site/hybrid)
Batch AB: "organizational development" OR "OD specialist" — Portland, OR + Seattle, WA
Batch AC: "talent development" OR "learning programs" coordinator — Portland, OR + Seattle, WA (NOT instructional design)
Batch AD: "HR associate" OR "HRBP associate" OR "people coordinator" — Portland, OR + suburbs (Beaverton, Hillsboro, Vancouver WA)
Batch AE: "culture specialist" OR "engagement coordinator" OR "workforce development" — Portland, OR + Seattle, WA
Batch AF: "training coordinator" OR "training specialist" — Portland, OR + Seattle, WA (verify: program delivery focus, NOT retail/store ops)
```

**Local broader-title guidance:** For Portland/Seattle in-person roles, also accept these broader titles IF job content is strong (OD, L&D ops, employee experience, program management, engagement):
- HR Associate / People Operations Associate (early career, ≤4 yrs required)
- Training Specialist / Training Coordinator (program design/delivery focus — NOT retail store training)
- Learning & Development Specialist (if NOT instructional design / Adobe Creative Suite / e-learning authoring)
- Employee Experience Coordinator
- Workforce Development Specialist (program ops focus — NOT vocational/trade certification)
- People Coordinator / HR Coordinator (career-building content, not pure admin)

**Hard reject even for local:** Retail operations training, HRIS admin, payroll, labor/union relations, full-cycle recruiting focus, "US Person only" / no H1B, 5+ years required.

> **When LinkedIn returns mostly staffing agency results:**
> Remove `f_TPR=r604800` (date filter) to expand scope, or switch to direct career sites.
> Staffing agency noise is common for HR keywords — don't give up, switch channels.

#### 2b. Direct Company Career Sites (Chrome)

Always check these directly — they don't always appear in LinkedIn searches:

**Consulting / green-light priority (P1):**
```
careers.mercer.com → search "analyst" OR "consultant" OR "program"
jobs.aon.com → search "talent" OR "people" OR "change"
careers.kornferry.com → search "analyst" OR "associate"
deloitte.com/careers → SKIP (confirmed no H1B in current program)
mckinsey.com/careers → worth checking
bcg.com/careers → SKIP (on skip list)
```

**Tech / mid-size companies (P2-P3):**
```
instacart.careers (already added today — check for other openings)
starbucks.com/careers → search "people" OR "L&D" OR "talent"
amazon.jobs → search "people experience" OR "HR program manager"
duolingo.com/careers → search "people" OR "talent"
auditboard.com/careers → search "people" OR "HR"
stripe.com/jobs → search "people programs"
airbnb.com/careers → search "employee experience" (non-AI/non-engineer)
figma.com/careers → search "people"
notion.so/careers → search "people"
loom.com/careers → search "people"
```

**Gaming / Entertainment / Media (strong P1 potential — tech culture + people programs):**
```
careers.roblox.com → search "people" OR "talent" OR "program manager" OR "early career"
careers.riotgames.com → search "people programs" OR "talent" OR "early career"
jobs.disneycareers.com → search "HR specialist" OR "people programs" OR "talent development"
jobs.netflix.com → search "people programs" OR "talent" OR "engagement"
spotify.com/us/jobs → search "people programs" OR "talent" OR "employee experience"
ea.com/careers → search "people" OR "talent" OR "HR"
activisionblizzard.com/careers → search "people programs" OR "HR"
epicgames.com/site/en-US/careers → search "people" OR "talent" OR "program"
```
⚠️ Gaming/entertainment companies (Roblox, Disney DET, etc.) run intern programs, early career programs,
and talent/engagement programs heavily. P1 roles like Early Career PM, HR Specialist, People Programs
Associate are frequently open. These companies H1B-sponsor actively. Worth checking every run.

**Healthtech / Clinical Tech (P1-P2 potential — tech salaries, strong people programs):**
```
flatiron.com/careers → search "talent" OR "engagement" OR "people programs" OR "associate"
epic.com/careers → search "HR" OR "people" OR "training" OR "talent"
veeva.com/careers → search "people" OR "talent" OR "HR"
modernhealth.com/company/careers → search "people" OR "talent"
headspace.com/careers → search "people" OR "employee experience"
hinge.health/careers → search "people programs" OR "talent"
```

**Nonprofits / Cap-Exempt (visa advantage — lower bar):**
```
peacehealth.org/careers → check for OD/talent/change roles
providence.jobs → search HR, learning, talent, OD roles — filter Portland, OR
ohsu.edu/careers (careersat-ohsu.icims.com) → OD/talent/L&D/HR roles
legacyhealth.org/careers → HR/talent/learning roles (confirm H1B before adding)
portlandstatejobs (jobs.hrc.pdx.edu) → HR/talent/OD/L&D roles (cap-exempt university)
uportland.edu careers → HR/talent roles (cap-exempt university)
reed.edu/careers → HR/talent roles (cap-exempt college)
nonprofitoregon.org/job-board → Oregon nonprofit HR/people/talent roles
```

> ⚠️ **Cap-exempt note:** Universities, nonprofits, and hospitals are H1B cap-exempt. Jamie can receive cap-exempt H1B sponsorship at any time of year (not just the April lottery). This is a MAJOR advantage — apply to cap-exempt employers even for roles where fit is 60-65% (Portland/Seattle moderate bar), especially if the H1B advantage offsets competition.

**Use WebSearch for Greenhouse/Lever bulk search:**

WebSearch: "performance management" program coordinator specialist -HRIS -Workday site:greenhouse.io 2026
```

#### 2d. Additional Job Boards (NEW v3.0 — non-LinkedIn sources)

> **These platforms surface roles that DON'T appear on LinkedIn.** Run every pipeline.
> Use WebSearch for initial discovery, then Chrome-verify any candidates found.

**Handshake (early career — Jamie's exact tier):**
```
WebSearch: site:joinhandshake.com "people programs" OR "talent programs" OR "HR program manager"
WebSearch: site:joinhandshake.com "employee experience" OR "engagement" coordinator OR specialist
WebSearch: site:joinhandshake.com "organizational development" OR "change management" analyst
```
⚠️ Handshake is the #1 platform for early career roles. Many companies post here EXCLUSIVELY
for entry/associate positions. High signal, very low noise vs LinkedIn.

**Built In (tech companies, curated):**
```
WebSearch: site:builtin.com/jobs "people programs" OR "talent" OR "employee experience" Portland OR Seattle OR "San Francisco" OR remote
WebSearch: site:builtin.com/jobs "HR program manager" OR "people operations" OR "OD specialist"
```
Built In PDX/Seattle/SF have curated tech company listings. Less staffing agency spam.

**SHRM Job Board (HR-specific):**
```
WebSearch: site:jobs.shrm.org "program manager" OR "OD specialist" OR "talent development" OR "engagement"
```
Niche HR board. Many HR professionals post here who don't use LinkedIn heavily.

**Idealist (nonprofits — cap-exempt potential):**
```
WebSearch: site:idealist.org "people" OR "HR" OR "talent" OR "organizational development" Portland OR Oregon OR remote
```
Nonprofits = cap-exempt H1B advantage. These roles rarely appear on LinkedIn.

**Wellfound / AngelList (startups):**
```
WebSearch: site:wellfound.com "people operations" OR "HR" OR "talent" OR "people programs"
```
Startups with < 200 employees often have fewer applicants. Good for standing out.

**Google for Jobs (aggregator of aggregators):**
```
WebSearch: "people programs manager" OR "talent programs coordinator" Portland OR Seattle OR remote "posted" site:google.com/search
```

#### 2d-2. Watchlist Company Check (NEW v3.0)

> **Read `jamie/watchlist.md` at the start of every run.**
> Check ALL companies marked 🔄 ACTIVE in Tiers 1-3 via WebSearch or Chrome.
> Update `last_checked` dates. Add any new companies discovered during search.

**Execution:**
1. Read `watchlist.md` → get list of active companies with careers URLs
2. For Tier 1-2 (tech + gaming): WebSearch `site:{careers_url} "people" OR "talent" OR "program"`
3. For Tier 3 (cap-exempt): WebSearch or Chrome direct-navigate to careers page
4. Any hits → add to Chrome verification queue (Step 3)
5. Update `last_checked` date in watchlist.md after each company is checked

#### 2d-3. H1B Verification Cache (NEW v3.0)

> **Read `jamie/h1b_verified.md` before assessing any candidate.**
> If company is ✅ Confirmed → skip H1B verification step.
> If company is ❌ No H1B → immediate reject.
> If company is NOT in the cache → verify via myvisajobs.com + JD language, then ADD to cache.

This eliminates redundant H1B checks across runs and builds a growing knowledge base.

#### 2d-4. HigherEdJobs — Cap-Exempt Employers (NEW v3.3)

> **Universities and research institutions are H1B CAP-EXEMPT.** Jamie can receive H1B
> sponsorship at any time of year — no April lottery. HigherEdJobs is THE dedicated board
> for these roles. Many positions here never appear on LinkedIn.

```
WebSearch: site:higheredjobs.com "people" OR "talent" OR "organizational development" OR "program manager" Portland OR Oregon OR remote
WebSearch: site:higheredjobs.com "HR" OR "human resources" "coordinator" OR "specialist" OR "associate" Oregon OR Washington OR remote
WebSearch: site:higheredjobs.com "learning" OR "training" OR "employee experience" "coordinator" OR "manager" remote OR Oregon
WebSearch: site:higheredjobs.com "change management" OR "OD" "specialist" OR "analyst" university
```

Also check individual university career pages directly:
```
WebSearch: site:jobs.hrc.pdx.edu "people" OR "talent" OR "HR" OR "learning" OR "OD"
WebSearch: site:uoregon.edu/jobs "people" OR "talent" OR "HR" OR "training"
WebSearch: site:oregonstate.edu/jobs "people" OR "HR" OR "talent development"
WebSearch: site:uw.edu/jobs "people" OR "talent" OR "HR" OR "organizational development"
```

#### 2d-5. Remote-Specific Job Boards (NEW v3.3)

> **These boards specialize in remote roles. Less noise than LinkedIn remote filters.**

```
WebSearch: site:flexjobs.com "people programs" OR "HR program manager" OR "talent development" OR "employee experience"
WebSearch: site:weworkremotely.com "people" OR "HR" OR "talent" OR "organizational development"
WebSearch: site:remote.co "people" OR "HR" OR "talent" OR "employee experience" OR "program manager"
WebSearch: site:himalayas.app "people" OR "HR" OR "talent" program manager OR specialist
```

Remote roles need 80%+ match + one advantage (per preferences.md). But these boards have
lower applicant volume than LinkedIn Remote, so competition may be more manageable.

#### 2d-6. Outcome Tracking (NEW v3.3)

> **After each pipeline run, check Jamie's Google Sheet for updates on past applications.**
> This builds a feedback loop to improve future scoring.

At the end of each run (after delivery):
1. Read the Google Sheet (2026 tab) via WebFetch CSV export
2. Look for status changes: "Applied" → "Interview" or "NGP" (Not God's Plan)
3. For any new "Interview" status: note which resume emphasis set was used, which outreach
   contacts were reached out to — this data improves future `/tailor` recommendations
4. For any new "NGP" status: note the rejection reason if available — add to dead leads
5. Update `jamie/search_strategy.md` with any new learnings

#### 2e. Job Title Reference — PRIORITY TIERS ← UPDATED v2.7

Click into JDs with ANY of these titles, even if the exact wording is slightly different.
**Accept if title fits domain; reject if JD is wrong scope.**

> ⚠️ **HARD RULE (v2.7): REJECT any role that requires more than 4 years of experience.**
> Jamie has ~3 years. Roles requiring 5+ years are too senior regardless of title.
> Check the "Required Experience" line in every JD before scoring fit.

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
P1 — BEST FIT: People Program Management (PRIMARY TARGET)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
These are the sweet spot — PM skills + people/talent/HR domain.
Always prioritize, always read full JD.

People Programs Manager / Coordinator / Lead
People Program Manager (any company)
Talent Development Program Manager
Early Talent Program Manager / Coordinator
Employee Experience Program Manager
HR Program Manager (if PM-heavy, NOT HRBP-heavy)
People Operations Program Manager
Workforce Development Program Manager
Talent Programs Coordinator / Specialist (if PM-scoped)
Learning Programs Manager / Coordinator (ops/logistics focus — NOT instructional design)
Employee Listening Program Manager
Feedback & Engagement Program Manager
Process Improvement / Workflow Optimization (in HR or People scope)
Program Manager, People Operations / Talent / HR (any PM role touching people/talent work)
Early Career Program Manager / Coordinator (intern/university program ops — data + events + process)
University Programs Manager / Campus Programs Coordinator (if PM-scoped, not pure recruiting)
Talent and Employee Engagement Associate / Coordinator (multi-domain: talent mgmt + L&D + EX + I&B)
People Programs Associate / Specialist (broad programs support role at tech companies)
Insights Analyst / Program Coordinator — people/EX context ONLY (see "Feedback Loop" scope pattern below)
Talent Management Program Coordinator / Specialist (programs focus — NOT recruiting/TA)
Talent Program Development Coordinator / Specialist (building/scaling talent programs)
Talent Operations Coordinator / Manager (program operations — scheduling, vendors, logistics)
Talent Strategy Analyst / Associate (if entry-level, programs-adjacent)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
⚠️ NON-TRADITIONAL P1 TITLES — search for these explicitly
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
These titles don't look like obvious PM or HR roles but map directly to Jamie's sweet spot.
ALWAYS click into these — don't judge by title alone, read the scope.

Service Insights Analyst / Coordinator (TikTok-type: gather voices → find patterns → drive improvements)
Experience Insights Analyst (employee or customer experience improvement cycle)
People Insights Analyst / Coordinator
Workforce Insights Analyst (if scope = program improvement, NOT pure HR analytics/HRIS)
Employee Listening Analyst / Specialist (listening programs + action planning)
Voice of Employee (VoE) Program Manager / Coordinator
Continuous Improvement Specialist — people OR HR OR talent context
Program Analytics Coordinator — people / talent context (NOT just reporting/BI)
Feedback Programs Coordinator / Analyst
Process Excellence Coordinator — people OR employee experience context
HR Specialist (at entertainment/media/gaming companies — Disney-type scope with process improvement + data)
Operations Analyst — talent OR people OR employee experience context (if improvement-cycle scoped)

🔍 SEARCH TRICK: For these non-traditional titles, use SCOPE keywords in search rather than title:
  → "identify patterns" OR "drive improvements" + "people" OR "talent" OR "employee"
  → "feedback" + "insights" + "program" + "coordinator" OR "analyst"
  → "voice of" + "employee" OR "customer" + "program" (in people ops / EX context)
  → "stakeholder feedback" + "improvement" + "program"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🟢 "FEEDBACK LOOP" SCOPE PATTERN — P1 regardless of title
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
If a JD's core scope matches this loop, treat it as P1 even with a non-PM title:
  gather stakeholder feedback / voices / data  →
  identify patterns / friction points / trends  →
  translate into actionable improvement recommendations  →
  implement and monitor program changes
This pattern appears in: Service Insights roles (TikTok-type), Insights Analyst, CX Program
Coordinator (if HR/people context), Employee Listening Analyst. These map perfectly to Jamie's
stated interest in collecting feedback → analyzing → improving programs with data.
⚠️ ONLY in people/employee/talent context. Customer service call center ops = skip.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
P2 — GREAT FIT: Employee Engagement / Experience + OD/OCM
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Strong domain alignment with Jamie's background.

Employee Engagement Manager / Specialist / Coordinator
Employee Experience Manager / Specialist
Culture & Engagement Specialist / Manager
People Experience Specialist / Coordinator
Organizational Development Specialist / Analyst / Coordinator
OD & Learning Specialist (if NOT instructional design)
Organizational Effectiveness Analyst / Specialist
Change Enablement Analyst / Specialist (OCM scope)
Organizational Change Management (OCM) Analyst / Specialist

Talent Development Specialist / Coordinator (if OD/learning program ops scope)
Learning Operations Coordinator / Manager (vendor/logistics, NOT instructional design)
Succession Planning Coordinator / Analyst (talent management programs)
Performance Management Program Coordinator (program ops — NOT HRIS/system admin)
Talent Review Coordinator / Analyst (talent calibration, reviews, program support)
Talent Initiatives Coordinator / Specialist (cross-functional talent programs)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
P3 — GOOD FIT: People/HR Consulting (ASSOCIATE / ENTRY LEVEL ONLY)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
⚠️ STRICT: Only include consulting roles with "Analyst", "Associate", or "Consultant I/II".
SKIP if title contains "Senior", "Manager", "Principal", "Lead", "Director".
Consulting domains: talent management, talent development, T&D, OD, EX, people strategy.

People Advisory Services Analyst / Associate
Talent & Org (T&O) Consultant / Analyst
Human Capital Consultant / Analyst (entry level)
HR Consulting Analyst / Associate
Talent Management Consulting Analyst
Talent Development Consulting Analyst / Associate
Workforce Transformation Analyst
Organizational Development Consulting Analyst
Training & Development Consultant (entry/analyst level)
Employee Experience Consultant (entry/analyst level)
People Strategy Analyst / Associate
Talent & Rewards Consulting Analyst

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
P4 — CONDITIONAL: HR / HRBP (ASSOCIATE or ASSISTANT ONLY)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
⚠️ STRICT: ONLY consider HR/HRBP roles if title explicitly includes "Associate", "Assistant",
or "Coordinator" AND the JD is clearly entry/early-career (≤2 yrs required, or
"no HR experience required" language). Mid-level HR Generalist and HRBP roles are OUT.

HR Associate / HR Assistant
HRBP Associate / HR Business Partner Associate
People Operations Associate / Coordinator
HR Coordinator (only if career-development focused, not pure admin)
People Coordinator
Associate People Partner / HR Partner

NOT acceptable at P4:
HR Generalist (mid-level — unless explicitly "Associate HR Generalist" or ≤2 yrs required)
HR Business Partner (unless "Associate HRBP" or "HRBP I")
HR Manager, People Manager, HR Director

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
REJECT IMMEDIATELY — do not click in, do not assess:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
"Instructional Designer", "Curriculum Developer", "Content Developer",
"eLearning Developer", "Learning Designer", "Training Developer",
"Recruiter", "Talent Acquisition", "Sourcer", "Recruiting Coordinator",
"HRIS", "Workday Admin", "HR Systems", "HR Technology",
"Payroll", "Benefits Analyst", "Compensation Analyst",
"Employee Relations Manager", "Labor Relations",
"Senior Consultant", "Manager, Consulting", "Principal Consultant",
"HR Generalist" (unless explicitly Associate/entry with ≤2 yrs required),
"HR Business Partner" (unless explicitly Associate/entry level),
"Director", "VP", "Head of", "Senior Manager",
Any JD requiring 5+ years of experience
```

#### 2f. Quality Gate Before Chrome Verification

Before spending Chrome verification time on a candidate, quick-check:
- **Does JD require more than 4 years?** → SKIP immediately. Check "Required" or "Minimum Qualifications" for "X years of experience". 5+ = skip.
- **No hard company skip list** — ALWAYS read the full JD to determine fit. A company you'd expect to be bad (TikTok, DoorDash, BCG, Deloitte, etc.) may have an excellent role that fits Jamie perfectly. Company reputation does NOT justify skipping — only the actual JD content determines fit.
  - Nike HQ is Beaverton, OR (Portland metro) — always check careers.nike.com for current HR/L&D/Talent/OD openings.
- Is the seniority clearly too high? (Director, VP, Senior Manager, 5+ years required) → skip
- Is it an HR/HRBP role that isn't explicitly associate/assistant/entry-level? → skip (mid-level HR generalist and HRBP roles are out per v2.7)
- Is it a consulting role at senior/manager/principal level? → skip (only analyst/associate consulting roles)
- Is it a staffing agency posting? (Insight Global, TEKsystems, Randstad, Robert Half, Apex Group) → skip the agency listing; if the client company is visible, search for the direct posting instead
- Is it clearly instructional design / ER / payroll / recruiting? → skip
- Is it contract/temp? → skip (H1B problematic)

**🟢 JD GREEN FLAG SIGNALS — if you see these phrases in the JD body, it's likely a strong fit:**
These patterns appear in all 4 of Jamie's "optimal JD" examples (Roblox, Flatiron, Disney, TikTok):
```
✅ "identify inefficiencies" / "recommend improvements" / "process improvements"
✅ "gather / collect feedback" + "drive improvements" / "translate into actionable"
✅ "continuously improving programs based on feedback and outcomes"
✅ "data-driven" / "maintain trackers or databases" / "run reports" / "dashboards"
✅ "project manage the operational details" of a people/talent program
✅ "stakeholder coordination" or "stakeholder management" in people/talent context
✅ "intern / early career programs" operations (not just recruiting)
✅ "employee engagement" + "analytics" / "program outcomes"
✅ "exposure to automation, tooling, or systems improvements" / "basic automation"
✅ "budget tracking" / "vendor coordination" in a people programs context
✅ "compliance training" / "onboarding facilitation" / "employee recognition programs"
✅ "voice of customer/employee" / "insights" + program improvement cycle
```
A JD body with 3+ of these signals = almost certainly a P1 fit regardless of the exact title.
Escalate these to full Chrome verification immediately.

Everything else → proceed to Chrome verification in Step 3.

> **QUALITY BAR — VERY HIGH STANDARD:**
> Only surface jobs that Jamie actually WANTS and is genuinely QUALIFIED for based on what she has done.
> - Do NOT include roles that lean on her ★☆☆ areas (instructional design, payroll, ER, HRIS systems)
> - Do NOT include roles where salary is too low for H1B prevailing wage
> - Do NOT include contract/temporary roles (H1B problematic)
> - **Do NOT stretch Jamie's experience — no forced connections between her background and the JD**
> - 0 picks is always better than 1 bad pick

**No Forced Connections Rule:**
> If you find yourself writing "Jamie's experience with X could translate to..." or "while not directly..."
> or "her background in X gives her a foundation for..." → STOP. That's a forced connection.
> The experience must be DIRECT AND HONEST. If it's a stretch, say so in the gaps section.
> Jamie's credibility depends on this.

**Skip list** — always re-query Notion at runtime.

### 🎯 Section 2g — Reference JD Profiles (Jamie's Optimal Roles)

> These are 4 real JDs that Jamie identified as near-perfect fits. Use them as calibration templates
> when assessing new candidates. If a new JD reminds you of one of these four — surface it.

---

**REF-1: Roblox — Early Career Program Manager** (San Mateo, CA | in-person Tue-Thu | $91K-$122K)
- **Why optimal:** Pure P1 — program management in early talent/campus space at a tech company.
  Data-oriented (maintain trackers, run reports), systems-minded (identify workflow inefficiencies,
  implement automation), events execution (intern events, campus programming), stakeholder management
  (Legal, People Ops, Facilities, Immigration). "Continuously improving programs based on feedback."
- **Key language to match:** "data oriented", "systems minded", "identify inefficiencies and manual
  workflows", "recommend improvements", "process enhancements", "basic automation", "program outcomes"
- **Find-alikes by searching:** "early career program manager", "university programs coordinator",
  "campus programs", "intern program manager" at tech companies

---

**REF-2: Flatiron Health — Talent and Employee Engagement Associate** (NY | hybrid 3 days | $88K-$121K)
- **Why optimal:** P1/P2 hybrid — one role spanning ALL people domains: talent management + L&D +
  inclusion & belonging + employee experience. "Associate" level = right seniority (3+ yrs req ✅).
  Scope includes: program coordination, project management, onboarding facilitation, engagement survey
  admin, LMS admin, systems analytics, budget tracking, internal comms, vendor coordination.
- **Key language to match:** "project management support across the team's work", "programmatic
  and project management support", "systems & program analytics", "reporting and analyses",
  "highly organized", "proactive", "talent management, L&D, I&B, and employee experience"
- **Find-alikes by searching:** "talent and engagement associate", "people programs associate",
  "employee engagement associate", at healthtech/oncology tech/mission-driven companies

---

**REF-3: Disney Entertainment Television — HR Specialist** (LA area | in-person | Disney campus)
- **Why optimal:** P4 at a dream employer — an HR Specialist role below HRBP level with
  genuine process improvement + data analysis scope embedded. "Administer and evaluate onboarding
  and offboarding processes end to end, including recommending and implementing process improvements
  to enhance the overall experience." Runs talent dashboards and reports. Workday/SAP experience valued.
  Multi-function exposure (OD, ER, TA, L&D, comp) = perfect learning ground.
- **Key language to match:** "implementing process improvements", "run and utilize reports and talent
  dashboards", "project management experience", "Experience advising on HR programs", "analytical
  skills to interpret data, identify trends, and recommend solutions"
- **Find-alikes by searching:** "HR Specialist" at entertainment/media/gaming (NOT "HR Generalist"
  mid-level). Also: "People Coordinator", "HR Associate" at Disney, Netflix, Spotify, EA, Nintendo.
  In-person/hybrid only for this archetype.

---

**REF-4: TikTok Shop — Service Insights (Feedback Loop role)** (US-based, 2026 new grad hire)
- **Why optimal:** Non-traditional P1 — title is ambiguous but scope is pure "Feedback→Improvement"
  loop work: gather customer/stakeholder voices → identify patterns and friction → translate to
  actionable improvement initiatives → cross-functional collaboration → monitor effectiveness.
  This maps EXACTLY to Jamie's stated goal of "collect feedback → improve programs → data analysis."
  Entry-level/new grad scope = right seniority.
- **Key language to match:** "gather and analyze customer feedback", "identify patterns and trends",
  "areas of friction and opportunities for improvement", "translate insights into actionable
  improvement initiatives", "monitor the effectiveness of implemented solutions"
- **Find-alikes by searching:** In HR/people context: "employee insights analyst", "people insights
  coordinator", "employee listening analyst", "HR continuous improvement". Also "service insights"
  at tech companies with large customer/employee programs (TikTok, Shopify, Salesforce, HubSpot).
  ⚠️ Must be in people/employee context — not customer service call center operations.

---

**Cross-reference: Common strengths valued across all 4 JDs:**
| Skill / Quality | How Jamie demonstrates it |
|---|---|
| Data analysis & reporting | Tracked program KPIs, 600+ trained, 20+ vendors managed |
| Process improvement mindset | Redesigned onboarding process, identified workflow gaps |
| Stakeholder management | Worked across HR, managers, vendors, cross-functional teams |
| Project/program coordination | PM role managing 3 concurrent programs with timelines/deliverables |
| Communication (written + verbal) | Internal comms, program documentation, presentations |
| Events execution | Coordinated learning events, culture activations, program workshops |
| Systems curiosity | Interest in automation, tooling improvements (per preferences.md) |

---

### Step 3 — Verification (MANDATORY — ALL candidates, exhaustive parallel approach v3.2)

> ⚠️ **EVERY candidate from ALL discovery agents MUST be verified before it goes anywhere.**
> This includes future-queue entries, not just today's picks.
> **An unverified URL must never enter the priority queue. Verify now or discard.**
>
> **Context window note:** Auto-compact fires automatically when context approaches its limit.
> The pipeline continues correctly after compaction because state is written to files progressively.
> Do NOT hold results in memory waiting to write at the end — write after every batch.

#### 3a. URL Routing — Split by ATS Type (do this FIRST)

Collect ALL URLs from Step 2. Route into buckets:

| Bucket | ATS / Domain | Method | Who handles it |
|--------|-------------|--------|---------------|
| **A** | `jobs.ashbyhq.com` | Chrome `get_page_text` — check for `"posting":null` | Main thread only |
| **B** | `job-boards.greenhouse.io`, `boards.greenhouse.io` | WebFetch — 404 / error page = expired | Parallel agents |
| **C** | `jobs.lever.co` | WebFetch — full JD returned = live, 404 = expired | Parallel agents |
| **D** | Workday (`wd5.myworkdayjobs.com`, etc.) | WebFetch — "page doesn't exist" = expired | Parallel agents |
| **E** | Direct company sites (Nike, Roblox, Stripe, HubSpot, etc.) | WebFetch first, Chrome fallback | Parallel agents |
| **F** | LinkedIn URLs | Chrome only — check for "No longer accepting applications" | Main thread |

#### 3b. Launch Parallel Verification (background agents — start immediately)

> **For batches B-E: launch background agents NOW while main thread handles Ashby (A) and LinkedIn (F).**
> Each agent receives 12-15 URLs, verifies all via WebFetch, writes results to a temp file, exits.
> Use `run_in_background: true` so main thread continues with Chrome work.

**Agent prompt template for WebFetch verification batches:**

```
You are a job posting verification agent for Jamie Cheng's job search pipeline.

Your task: verify whether each of the following job postings is live or expired.

METHOD for each URL:
1. Call WebFetch(url) — read the response
2. For Greenhouse: expired if response contains "An error occurred" or URL has "?error=true"
3. For Lever: expired if response is a 404 or contains "Job not found" or "This job is no longer available"
4. For Workday: expired if response contains "The page you are looking for doesn't exist"
5. For company sites: expired if response is a generic careers/search page (no specific JD), 404, or "position has been filled"
6. If live: extract from the response — (a) YOE required, (b) location, (c) salary range if present, (d) any "no sponsorship" language, (e) posting date if visible

For each URL, also apply hard gates immediately:
- REJECT if YOE required > 4 years
- REJECT if "no visa sponsorship" / "US citizens only" / "must be authorized to work"
- REJECT if contract/temp only
- REJECT if outside US (unless explicitly remote with no state restrictions)

PROGRESSIVE WRITE RULE: After verifying every 5 URLs, append results to the output file below.
Do NOT wait until all URLs are done — write partial results immediately. This ensures results
are not lost if context compacts mid-run.

Write results to: C:\Users\chent\Agentic_Workflows_2026\oracle-job-search\job-search\verify_batch_{BATCH_ID}.json

Format:
[
  {
    "url": "https://...",
    "status": "live" | "expired" | "unknown",
    "yoe_req": "2-3 years" | "not stated" | "5+ years (REJECT)",
    "location": "Portland OR (hybrid)" | "Remote" | "NYC (on-site)" | "unknown",
    "salary": "$70-90K" | "not stated",
    "h1b_flag": "no sponsorship language (ok)" | "REJECT: explicit no sponsorship",
    "posting_date": "2026-03-20" | "unknown",
    "notes": "brief note on what you saw"
  }
]

If WebFetch fails (403, timeout, blocked), mark status "unknown" and note the error.
Do NOT retry more than once per URL.

URLs to verify:
{LIST OF 12-15 URLS}
```

**How many agents to launch:**
- Up to 100 candidates → launch ceil(non-Ashby-count / 15) agents (max 6)
- Example: 60 Greenhouse/Lever/Direct URLs → launch 4 agents of 15 each
- Name batch files: `verify_batch_greenhouse1.json`, `verify_batch_lever1.json`, `verify_batch_direct1.json`, etc.

#### 3c. Main Thread: Ashby Verification (Chrome)

While background agents run, main thread verifies Ashby URLs one by one:

```
For each Ashby URL:
  1. navigate(url)
  2. get_page_text(tabId)
  3. Search output for "posting":null
     - Contains "posting":null → EXPIRED
     - Contains "posting":{...} with actual data → LIVE
       Extract: YOE req, location, salary, posting date from the JSON
  4. Apply hard gates (5+ yrs, no sponsorship, contract)
```

Write Ashby results progressively (every 5 URLs) to:
`C:\Users\chent\Agentic_Workflows_2026\oracle-job-search\job-search\verify_batch_ashby.json`

Same format as agent batches above.

> ⚠️ If Chrome blocks `jobs.ashbyhq.com` ("This site is blocked"): mark status "unknown — chrome blocked".
> Do NOT include unknown-status Ashby URLs in today's picks.
> DO add them to the priority queue with "⚠️ ashby-unverified" flag for manual check.

#### 3d. Main Thread: LinkedIn Verification (Chrome)

For any LinkedIn job URLs:
```
1. navigate(linkedin_url)
2. Run JS to expand JD: document.querySelectorAll('button').forEach(b => {
     if (b.innerText.includes('Show more') || b.innerText.includes('See more')) b.click();
   });
3. get_page_text(tabId)
4. Check for:
   - "No longer accepting applications" → EXPIRED
   - "This job is no longer available" → EXPIRED
   - "Reposted X years ago" with 0 applicants → EXPIRED (zombie listing)
   - Active apply button + full JD → LIVE
5. Extract YOE, location, salary, posting date from expanded text
```

#### 3e. Collect All Results

After all background agents complete AND Chrome work is done:

1. Read all `verify_batch_*.json` files
2. Merge into a single verified candidates list
3. Apply final deduplication (same role may appear in multiple batches)
4. Sort: live passes (ordered by urgency/freshness) → unknowns → expired

**Write merged results to:**
`C:\Users\chent\Agentic_Workflows_2026\oracle-job-search\job-search\verified_candidates.json`

Format:
```json
{
  "run_date": "2026-03-25",
  "total_verified": 87,
  "live_passes": 23,
  "expired": 58,
  "unknown": 6,
  "candidates": [
    {
      "url": "...",
      "company": "...",
      "title": "...",
      "status": "live",
      "yoe_req": "2-3 years",
      "location": "SF hybrid",
      "salary": "$83-118K",
      "h1b_flag": "ok",
      "posting_date": "2026-03-21",
      "freshness": "🔶 FRESH",
      "verified_method": "Chrome Ashby",
      "verified_date": "2026-03-25"
    }
  ]
}
```

This file persists across sessions — if the pipeline is interrupted and resumed in a new session,
start Step 4 from this file rather than re-verifying.

#### 3f. Per-Candidate JD Read (live passes only)

For each candidate with `status: "live"`, read the full JD to extract enrichment data.
WebFetch verification already gives partial data. Fill in any missing fields:
- State eligibility restrictions (search JD for "eligible states", "authorized to work in")
- If Oregon excluded → flag "⚠️ Oregon NOT listed as eligible state"
- Confirm exact posting date from the page (not Google/search results)
- Note any sponsorship language explicitly stated

> 🤖 **GEMINI — pipe each fetched JD text for structured extraction:**
> After WebFetch returns a JD page, pipe the raw text to Gemini Flash:
> ```bash
> echo "$JD_RAW_TEXT" | gemini -m gemini-2.5-pro -p "Extract from this job description: (1) exact years experience required, (2) eligible states if mentioned, (3) any sponsorship language (exact quote), (4) posting date, (5) salary range if listed, (6) work type (remote/hybrid/onsite), (7) top 5 required qualifications. Return as labeled fields, one per line."
> ```
> Claude reads Gemini's extracted fields — do NOT re-read the full JD yourself.

> **Freshness rule:** REJECT if posted > 30 days ago. Prefer < 14 days.

### Step 4 — Honest Fit Assessment

> **Be Jamie's honest advisor, not her hype machine.**

For each verified-live candidate, assess against Jamie's ACTUAL experience from `resume.md`:

> ⚠️ **HARD EXPERIENCE RULE (v2.7):** If the JD requires more than 4 years of experience anywhere in the posting (required qualifications, "minimum X years"), **REJECT immediately**. Jamie has ~3 years. Do not assess fit further for 5+ year roles.

**4a. In-person / Hybrid (ANY US location) — PREFERRED, MODERATE bar (65%+ actual JD match):** ← NEW v2.7
- In-person/hybrid roles are now the primary target — less national competition, local presence = real advantage
- West Coast (Portland, Seattle, Bay Area, LA, San Diego) preferred but other US cities are acceptable if role fits
- JD must align with P1–P3 priority tiers (program management, engagement/OD, consulting)
- Do NOT surface roles where JD leans on ★☆☆ areas (instructional design, payroll, ER, HRIS)
- **⚠️ If eligible-states restriction applies and Oregon is excluded → flag it, but this is less critical for in-person roles**

**4b. Remote — HIGH bar (85%+ actual JD match), only if genuinely exceptional:** ← UPDATED v2.7
- Remote roles attract national competition. Jamie's H1B status + 3 years = tougher sell than a local US citizen.
- Only surface a remote role if ALL of the following are true:
  - 85%+ honest JD match (near-perfect fit)
  - At least one of: confirmed H1B sponsor, networking connection, cap-exempt employer, P1 consulting
  - Role is clearly P1 or P2 tier (program management or consulting)
  - Oregon is listed as eligible state (or no state restriction exists)
- If ANY condition is missing → SKIP the remote role, don't pick it over a local alternative
- **Bottom line: a decent local role beats a great remote role.**

**4c. Portland / Seattle / Pacific Northwest — STILL best if available:**
- Local Pacific Northwest presence = lowest competition + H1B cap-exempt university/hospital advantage
- Accept 60%+ fit for Portland/Seattle in-person if P1–P2 tier
- JD should not lean heavily on ★☆☆ areas

**4d. Check against self-assessment in preferences.md:**
- If role leans on ★☆☆ areas (instructional design, payroll, ER) → probably not a fit

**4e. Company quality check ← NEW v2.4:**
- Always search Glassdoor for every company before adding to Notion
- Glassdoor < 3.0/5 → immediate reject (toxic culture, not worth Jamie's time)
- Glassdoor 3.0–3.4/5 → flag as ⚠️ Caution; only proceed if everything else is outstanding
- Glassdoor 3.5+/5 → OK (note any relevant culture issues in the Notion entry)
- If Glassdoor review mentions: mass layoffs (< 6 months ago), hostile management, "promote then fire", "toxic" culture → add as ⚠️ flag even at 3.5+

**4f. Explicit gap analysis for each candidate:**
- ✅ What Jamie genuinely matches (with evidence from actual work)
- ⚠️ Where she's a stretch (developing skills positioned as strong)
- ❌ What she's missing (hard requirements she doesn't meet)
- If ❌ list has more than 1-2 hard requirements → SKIP

### Step 5 — Score and Present ALL Viable Candidates

**Scoring (weight order):**
1. **Visa certainty** (cap-exempt > confirmed H1B sponsor > unknown)
   - **🏛️ Cap-exempt bonus (+10%):** Universities, nonprofits (501(c)(3/4)), and hospitals
     are H1B cap-exempt — no lottery, no timing constraint, year-round sponsorship.
     This is Jamie's strongest visa path. Cap-exempt employers get a +10% scoring bonus.
   - Cap-exempt + Portland/Seattle = best possible combination. Prioritize these above all.
2. **Honest fit score** — real JD match percentage based on actual experience
3. **Role-priority tier** (P1 > P2 > P3 > P4)
4. **Location** (Portland/Seattle in-person > Other US in-person/hybrid > Remote-exceptional-fit only)
5. **Freshness** (< 7 days > 7-14 > 14-30)

> **Cap-exempt discovery is the highest-value activity in this pipeline.**
> Tech companies found via ATS APIs are useful but secondary. The Portland cap-exempt
> roles from Agent D (HigherEdJobs, Idealist, university career sites) and Agent F
> (PNW local searches) are often harder to find but far more actionable for Jamie.

> ⚠️ **EXPERIENCE GATE:** Any role requiring 5+ years → automatic disqualification before scoring.

**Present ALL candidates that pass the HARD CONSTRAINTS. Do NOT over-filter.**
Jamie will decide which to apply to. She benefits from seeing the full landscape.
The pipeline's job is to FIND and VERIFY roles, not to gatekeep them.

**Hard constraints (auto-reject):**
- Requires 5+ years experience
- Explicitly says "no sponsorship" / "US citizens only"
- Non-US location
- Senior/Director/VP/C-level title

**Everything else gets included in the email digest**, even if it's a stretch.
For each role, provide enough info for Jamie to decide:
- Posted date, salary, YOE requirement, location, H1B status
- 1-2 sentence honest assessment of fit and gaps
- Cap-exempt status clearly marked

Enrichment (cover letter, networking) is done for the top 3, but all viable roles
appear in the email digest ranked by score with full details.

**Fit Score formula (v3.4.1) — compute a 0-100 numerical score for EVERY candidate:**

```
Base score = JD match % (honest assessment vs Jamie's actual experience)
  +10 if cap-exempt employer (hospital/university/501c3 nonprofit)
  +5  if confirmed H1B sponsor (per h1b_verified.md or JD states it)
  +5  if Portland or Seattle in-person/hybrid
  +3  if P1 or P2 role priority tier
  -10 if remote-only (national competition, harder for H1B)
  -5  if requires 3-4 yrs experience (Jamie has ~3, borderline)

Cap at 100. Round to nearest whole number.
Store this number in the Notion "Fit Score" property (0-100).
```

**JD match % guidelines (the Base score):**
- 80-100%: Jamie hits every core requirement with direct experience
- 65-79%: Strong on 3-4 core requirements, 1-2 gaps that are learnable
- 55-64%: Hits the theme but missing 2+ core requirements or lacks direct examples
- Below 55%: Auto-skip (don't add to Notion)

**Rating (star bracket — derived from Fit Score):**
- ⭐⭐⭐ Perfect = Fit Score ≥ 80
- ⭐⭐ Good = Fit Score 65–79
- ⭐ Worth reviewing = Fit Score 55–64

**Urgency tag (v3.4.1) — stored in Notion "Urgency" select AND shown in email:**
- 🚨 Urgent = posted < 7 days ago — flag in email: "apply within 24-48 hrs!"
- 🔶 Fresh = posted 7-14 days ago — flag in email: "apply this week"
- ⏳ Aging = posted 14-30 days ago — still worth applying, note in email
- 💤 Stale = posted 30+ days ago — only if Fit Score ≥ 80, otherwise skip

### Step 6 — Add to Notion (honest content)

> 🤖 **GEMINI — draft all Notion prose sections before Claude writes to Notion:**
> Pipe JD text + Jamie's profile to Gemini Pro to generate the content blocks.
> Claude then reviews, spot-checks for invented experience, and writes to Notion via MCP.
> ```bash
> cat "oracle-job-search/jamie/profile_compact.md" > /tmp/notion_draft_input.txt
> echo "--- JOB DESCRIPTION ---" >> /tmp/notion_draft_input.txt
> echo "$JD_TEXT" >> /tmp/notion_draft_input.txt
> cat /tmp/notion_draft_input.txt | gemini -m gemini-2.5-pro -p "Draft Notion enrichment page for Jamie Cheng applying to this role. Sections needed: (1) Why This Fits Jamie — 3 honest bullets citing her ACTUAL experience, (2) Gaps to Address — 2 honest gaps with mitigation, (3) Resume Tailoring — 3 specific bullet swaps (original → revised with JD keyword, must use only experience she actually has), (4) Outreach — 2 networking contact types to search for with draft LinkedIn messages in Jamie's voice (<300 chars each), (5) H1B Note — what we know and what to verify. Return labeled sections, plain text."
> ```
> **Claude's job after Gemini draft:** verify no invented accomplishments → write to Notion MCP.

For each pick (max 3), create a Notion page in DB `442438a9-e372-48b7-b5f5-5f6ed8ee8e99`.

**Properties** (match schema exactly):
- Job Title (title), Company (text), Location (text)
- Category (select: Consulting, Program Management, L&D, HR/HRBP, OD/OCM/EX, Others)
- userDefined:URL (url), Company URL (url), Notes (text — empty or one-line)
- LinkedIn Link (url) — **REQUIRED**: Always include the LinkedIn job posting URL when available. LinkedIn is the primary search platform.
- Official Link (url) — The company's direct careers page URL for this role (e.g., Greenhouse, Lever, Workday, company site)
- Posted Date (date — REAL from Chrome), Added Date (date — today)
- H1B Friendly (select: ✅ Confirmed, 🏛️ Cap-Exempt, ❓ Unknown, ❌ No Sponsorship)
- Rating (select: ⭐⭐⭐ Perfect, ⭐⭐ Good, ⭐ Near-miss)
- Fit Score (number — 0-100, computed via formula above — REQUIRED v3.4.1)
- Urgency (select: 🚨 Urgent, 🔶 Fresh, ⏳ Aging, 💤 Stale — based on posted date — REQUIRED v3.4.1)
- Status = "Not started" (Notion native status field — pipeline adds new roles as "Not started"; Jamie moves to "Applied" when she submits)

**Page Content — use EXACT PAGE FORMAT from template below.**

**CRITICAL content rules:**
- **Resume tailoring:** ONLY reword things Jamie actually did. Never invent experience.
- **Cover letter:** Honest pitch. Say "I'm building skills in X" rather than claiming expertise she doesn't have.
- **Fit table:** MUST include ⚠️ Gaps section. Never skip it.
- **Networking:** Use Chrome to find REAL LinkedIn profiles with actual URLs.

---

### 📄 EXACT PAGE FORMAT — OPERATIONAL STANDARD (v3.1)

> ⚠️ **CONTENT QUALITY RULE:** Every Notion page must be immediately actionable.
> Jamie should be able to open a page and start working — no lookup steps needed.
> - All LinkedIn URLs must be real, working URLs found via search (not placeholders)
> - All outreach messages must be fully written in Jamie's voice, ready to copy-paste
> - All resume bullet swaps must cite the SPECIFIC content_library.md variant name + full text
> - Cover letter must be complete 250-350 word final draft, not instructions
> - Interview prep items must be role-specific (company name, actual news, actual JD requirement)
> - If you can't find a real LinkedIn URL for a contact, write "URL not found" — never write a fake URL
>
> **The email and the Notion page should have the same operational quality.**
> The Notion page is Jamie's prep workbook. It must be richer than the email, not sparser.

✏️ Resume Tailoring for This Role:

   📌 Key JD keywords to weave in: {5-8 keywords from JD that Jamie can credibly claim}

   🔄 Suggested bullet swaps (from jamie_content_library.md):
   • InGenius role → use "{EMPHASIS}" variant:

     SWAP TO: "{specific variant from content_library.md that better matches this JD}"
     WHY: {1 sentence — what JD language this aligns with}

   • {Another gap — e.g., "5 years people analytics with Visier/Tableau"}

   💡 Prompt for Jamie to paste into another AI for further refinement:

```

> **CRITICAL EMAIL RULES:**
> - **ALL URLs must be clickable** — write them as full `https://...` URLs on their own line.
>   Gmail auto-links plain URLs. Do NOT use markdown `[text](url)` — Gmail doesn't render it.
>   LinkedIn profile URLs must be full URLs like `https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarahkim/`
>   so Jamie can click directly from the email to open the profile.
> - Every networking contact MUST have their full clickable LinkedIn URL
> - Every draft message MUST be personalized to the contact (reference their work/title/background)
> - Draft messages must be ≤ 300 characters for LinkedIn connection requests
> - **Resume tailoring section per pick is MANDATORY** — include specific bullet swaps from
>   `jamie_content_library.md`, JD keywords, gaps to avoid, and a ready-to-paste AI prompt
> - The email alone should give Jamie everything she needs to:
>   1. Click a link and apply
>   2. Click a LinkedIn profile and send a connection request with the draft message
>   3. Know exactly which resume bullets to swap and which keywords to add
>   4. Paste a prompt into another AI for further resume refinement
> - Notion has the DEEP content (cover letter, full company research, interview prep)
> - The email has the ACTION content (who to contact, what to say, where to apply, how to tailor)

### Step 9 — Write telegram_msg.txt

> 🤖 **GEMINI — draft Telegram message:**
> ```bash
> echo "$PICKS_ONE_LINERS" | gemini -m gemini-2.5-pro -p "Write a short Telegram job digest message for Jamie. Format: emoji header, numbered picks (company - title - location, one-line why, URL), cleanup count, encouragement. Plain text, under 500 chars total."
> ```
> Claude writes output to `telegram_msg.txt`.

```
🐣 Oracle's Daily Top {N} ({MONTH} {DAY}):

🌟 #1 {COMPANY} - {JOB_TITLE} ({LOCATION})
{ONE_LINE_WHY}
{URL}

(repeat for ALL viable picks — no cap)

🧹 Marked {N} expired entries as Pass
📊 Notion updated ✅
加油 Jamie! 💪🌈
```

### Step 10 — Write jobs_rows.json

```json
[
  ["{URL}", "{DATE}", "{JOB_TITLE}", "{COMPANY}", "{CATEGORY}", "{LOCATION}", "", "{ONE_LINE_WHY}"],
  ...
]
```

### Step 11 — Email Draft Delivery

> ⚡ **TOKEN-EFFICIENT METHOD (preferred):** Output the email body as plain text directly
> in the chat. David copies and pastes it into Gmail manually. Zero Chrome tokens spent.
> Only use Chrome injection as a fallback if David explicitly asks.

**Standard method:**
1. Write body to `email_body.txt` (always do this regardless of delivery method)
2. Output the full email body as a code block in the chat response
3. Tell David: "Copy the text above → Gmail → New Compose → To: jamiecheng0103@gmail.com → Subject: 🌸✨ 每日工作小汇报 · Daily Job Digest ✨🌸 → Paste body → Save as draft"

**Fallback (Chrome injection — only if David requests):**
Use `gmail_create_draft` MCP or Chrome JS inject. Do NOT use this by default —
Chrome navigation for Gmail costs ~5-10K tokens and is fragile (body injection breaks on navigation).

> **URL clickability:** Use plain text only. Gmail auto-links all `https://` URLs.
> Do NOT use markdown `[text](url)` syntax — Gmail doesn't render it.
> Put every URL on its own line.

### Step 12 — Send Telegram (best effort)

POST to `https://api.telegram.org/bot{TOKEN}/sendMessage` with telegram_msg.txt.
If blocked (expected — VM egress proxy), note it.

### Step 13 — Tell User to Run Delivery Script

**Always end by giving the user this exact PowerShell command to run:**

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\Users\chent\Agentic_Workflows_2026\oracle-job-search\run_oracle.ps1"
```

This command does 2 things:
1. Sends email via `gog.exe` (skips if `email_body.txt` not present — OK when using Gmail MCP draft instead)
2. Sends Telegram digest (skips if `telegram_msg.txt` not present)

Note: Archiving/deletion is NO LONGER performed. Expired entries are marked "Pass 👋" directly in Notion during the audit step, preserving all records.

---

### Step 14 — Terminal Run Summary (MANDATORY — output as one complete block)

> **Always output this after Step 13 — and again after all late background agents finish.**
> This is David's single checkpoint to verify the run is complete and correct.
> Never fragment it across messages. One clean block, every time.

> **When background agents arrive late (after Step 13 already ran):**
> - Acknowledge each arriving agent in 1–2 lines (confirmed expired / gate fail / new live pick)
> - If a new live candidate passes all gates → add to email draft, Notion, and queue; note it
> - Once ALL late agents are processed → re-output the full Terminal Summary above, marked "UPDATED"
> - Never leave David with a fragmented view — always close with the complete block

## ⚠️ Known Issues & Workarounds

### VM Egress Proxy Blocks
Many domains blocked from VM: linkedin.com, glassdoor.com, indeed.com, greenhouse.io, lever.co, workday sites. **Workaround: Chrome browser handles all direct job page access.** VM WebSearch still works for Google queries.

### `notion-update-page` MCP Tool
`update_properties` works for simple changes. For complex content updates or if it fails with bug #153, create a REPLACEMENT entry and add OLD page ID to `cleanup_pages.json`.

### Gmail Draft
Use `gmail_create_draft` MCP tool to create the draft. Subject: "🌸✨ 每日工作小汇报 · Daily Job Digest ✨🌸", To: jamiecheng0103@gmail.com, body from email_body.txt.

*v3.1.0 — Mar 24, 2026: CONTENT LIBRARY + EXPANDED SEARCH. (1) JAMIE CONTENT LIBRARY: Created `jamie_content_library.md` — master file with all resume bullet variants (PM/L&D/EX/vendor emphasis per role), 6 self-intro versions, 6 recruiter/hiring manager email templates, "why company" building blocks, "what makes me stand out" paragraphs, remote work statement, HRIS/tools statement, and work sample description. Pipeline now pulls from pre-written content variants instead of generating from scratch. (2) TALENT MANAGEMENT SEARCH EXPANSION: Added 6 new P1 LinkedIn batches (H5-H10): talent management program, talent program development, talent development program, talent operations, talent strategy, workforce planning. Added 5 new P2 batches (R11-R15): talent management specialist, talent program specialist, succession planning, talent initiatives, performance management program. Added 7 new WebSearch queries and 10 new Greenhouse/Lever site: queries for talent management/development. Added 4 new P1 titles (Talent Management Program Coordinator, Talent Program Development Coordinator, Talent Operations Coordinator, Talent Strategy Analyst) and 4 new P2 titles (Succession Planning Coordinator, Performance Management Program Coordinator, Talent Review Coordinator, Talent Initiatives Coordinator). (3) EMAIL AS ACTION SHEET: Email digest now includes full networking contacts with LinkedIn URLs, draft outreach messages (copy-paste ready), connection type (recruiter/alumni/hiring manager/team), salary range, H1B status, urgency tag, and per-pick action checklist. Jamie can start outreach directly from the email without opening Notion. (4) OUTREACH FORMAT SELECTION: Each networking contact now specifies the right outreach format — LinkedIn connection request (short), recruiter email (medium), hiring manager email (long), or alumni connection — drawn from the appropriate template source.*

*v3.0.0 — Mar 24, 2026: MAJOR ARCHITECTURE UPGRADE. (1) MULTI-AGENT PIPELINE: Added Agent decomposition diagram and parallelization rules — Step 1+2 run simultaneously, discovery uses parallel background agents, enrichment per-pick parallelized. (2) EXPANDED JOB BOARDS: Added Handshake (early career — Jamie's exact tier), Built In PDX/Seattle/SF (curated tech), SHRM JobBoard (HR-specific), Idealist (nonprofits/cap-exempt), Wellfound (startups), Google for Jobs. (3) COMPANY WATCHLIST: Created `watchlist.md` with 80+ target companies across 7 tiers — checked systematically every run with `last_checked` tracking. (4) H1B VERIFICATION CACHE: Created `h1b_verified.md` — eliminates redundant H1B checks. 27 confirmed sponsors, 14 cap-exempt, 2 confirmed no-H1B cached from day 1. (5) NETWORKING OUTREACH PROTOCOL: Created `outreach_templates.md` with Jamie's real message samples, personalization formula, and contact-finding protocol. Every Notion pick now includes personalized draft messages referencing specific details from contact's LinkedIn profile. (6) URGENCY SCORING: Added ⚡URGENT/🔶FRESH/⏳AGING/💤STALE tags based on posting age. Email digest now shows urgency prominently. (7) CAP-EXEMPT DEDICATED LOOP: Tier 3 of watchlist ensures Portland/Seattle hospitals, universities, nonprofits are checked every single run.*

*v2.8.1 — Mar 20, 2026: NON-TRADITIONAL TITLE EXPANSION. Added explicit "Non-Traditional P1 Titles" block covering: Service Insights Analyst, Experience Insights Analyst, People Insights Analyst, Workforce Insights Analyst, Employee Listening Analyst, Voice of Employee (VoE) Program Coordinator, Continuous Improvement Specialist (people context), Feedback Programs Coordinator, Process Excellence Coordinator, HR Specialist (Disney-type scope), Operations Analyst (people/EX context). Added scope-keyword search trick for finding these roles when title-based search fails. Added 5 new LinkedIn batches (R5–R10): service insights, workforce insights, continuous improvement, program excellence, CX program coordinator, stakeholder feedback. Added 5 new WebSearch queries and 4 new Greenhouse/Lever site: queries for these non-traditional titles.*

*v2.8 — Mar 20, 2026: JD CALIBRATION UPDATE based on 4 optimal JDs from Jamie (Roblox Early Career PM, Flatiron Talent & Engagement Associate, Disney HR Specialist, TikTok Shop Service Insights). (1) NEW P1 TITLES: "Early Career Program Manager", "Talent and Employee Engagement Associate", "People Programs Associate", "University Programs Coordinator" added to P1 tier. (2) NEW "FEEDBACK LOOP" SCOPE PATTERN: Any JD whose core scope is gather-feedback → identify-patterns → translate-to-improvements → monitor is treated as P1 regardless of title. (3) NEW GREEN FLAG SIGNALS: Added explicit JD language signals (e.g., "identify inefficiencies", "continuously improving programs based on feedback", "exposure to automation/tooling") that strongly predict fit. (4) NEW COMPANY SECTORS: Added Gaming/Entertainment (Roblox, Disney, EA, Netflix, Spotify, Epic Games) and Healthtech (Flatiron, Epic, Veeva, Modern Health) to direct site checklist. (5) NEW LINKEDIN BATCHES: H2 "early career program manager", H3 "talent and engagement associate", H4 "people programs associate", R2 "employee insights analyst", R3 "voice of employee feedback", R4 "HR specialist associate". (6) NEW SECTION 2f: Reference JD Profiles — detailed calibration guides for all 4 optimal JDs with find-alike search strategies.*

*v2.7 — Mar 20, 2026: Major strategy update. (1) PRIORITY TIER OVERHAUL: P1 = People Program Management (primary target — PM skills + people/talent/HR domain); P2 = Employee Engagement/Experience + OD/OCM; P3 = People/HR Consulting (associate/analyst ONLY — no senior/manager consulting); P4 = HR/HRBP Associate or Assistant ONLY (mid-level HR Generalist and HRBP are OUT). (2) EXPERIENCE GATE: Any JD requiring 5+ years = automatic reject at quality gate. Max 4 years required. (3) LOCATION FLIP: In-person/hybrid is now the primary target — less competition, real local advantage. Remote only if near-perfect P1 fit + confirmed H1B + Oregon eligible. West Coast preferred but any US in-person role is fine. (4) LinkedIn search batches reorganized into P1/P2/P3 priority groups with PM-heavy searches leading. (5) Reject list expanded: HR Generalist (mid-level), HRBP (non-associate), senior consulting, any 5+ yr requirement.*

*v2.6 — Mar 4, 2026: Completely rewrote Step 2 (Discovery). New philosophy: scan ~1000 listings across all sources, surface ~20–40 for review, pick max 3. Added 18 LinkedIn search batches (A–U) with exact URL templates. Added direct company career site checklist (Mercer, Aon, Korn Ferry, Starbucks, Amazon, Duolingo, AuditBoard, Stripe, Figma, Notion, PeaceHealth, Providence, etc.). Added WebSearch Greenhouse/Lever bulk query templates. Added full expanded job title list (accept/reject by domain). Added 2e Quality Gate to skip obvious rejects before Chrome verification.*

*v2.6 — Mar 5, 2026: (1) New dead-signal patterns: Workday "page doesn't exist" = expired; LinkedIn "Reposted X years ago + 0 applicants" = zombie ghost listing; company homepage URL with no job ID = unverifiable. (2) ALL "Pass 👋" entries MUST be archived each run. (3) CRITICAL: public/nonprofit cap-exempt employers may still explicitly say "no visa sponsorship" — always READ the full job posting for sponsorship language even for cap-exempt orgs. PCC (Portland Community College) posted "not currently able to provide visa sponsorship" despite being cap-exempt. DELETE any posting with explicit no-sponsorship language regardless of org type. (4) Updated SKILL.md Notion search batch keywords to include known active companies. Lesson: Mar 4-5 audit removed 11 entries total across two runs — exhaustive multi-pass Chrome verification is mandatory.*

*v2.5 — Mar 4, 2026: Added 0/5 dead-job failure story to Chrome prerequisites section (the "stale listing" problem — aggregators don't update when jobs close). Added resume exaggeration trap warning to Pipeline Philosophy. Added "why remote is harder" context. Chrome is now the MANDATORY verification backbone, not optional.*

*v2.4 — Mar 4, 2026: (1) Meticulous Chrome-verify: use `get_page_text` not just screenshot/tab-title; explicit status signals for Greenhouse/Lever/LinkedIn/ZipRecruiter dead-page patterns. (2) JD-Expansion Protocol: expanded search titles (OCM, Change Enablement, Employee Listening, People Experience, etc.); pivot to direct career sites when LinkedIn returns staffing agency noise; click into JD even if title doesn't match keywords. (3) No Forced Connections Rule: if you're bridging unrelated experience → stop, flag it as a gap. (4) Remote state-eligibility check: always scan JD for eligible-states list; Oregon exclusion = immediate flag/reject. (5) Archive-Not-Pass: write rejected roles to cleanup_pages.json instead of marking "Pass 👋" in Notion. (6) Company Quality Check: Glassdoor < 3.0 = reject; 3.0–3.4 = caution flag.*

*v2.3 — Mar 4, 2026: Step 1 DB audit now runs 10+ keyword-batched notion-search queries to find all 20–40+ entries (not just top 10). cleanup_pages.json format updated to use `id` field (matching run_oracle.ps1). v2.2: LinkedIn-first search, quality bar reinforced, LinkedIn Link + Official Link columns, Gmail draft via MCP.*
